Angler Shop (formally "No Fishing Quests"), Adds a shop button to the Angler. Now you can get your Cell Phone without needing to fish endlessly! For more info visit my homepage!

The items Fin Wings, Bottomless Water Bucket, Super Absorbant Sponge, and Hotline Fishing Hook 
are only available once in hardmode - just like fishing quest rewards.

Special Thanks:
