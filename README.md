# Angler Shop (formally "No Fishing Quests")
This mod adds a shop button to the Angler NPC. Now you can get your Cell Phone without needing to fish endlessly!
The Quest button is still there if you'd like to fish.

The items Fin Wings, and Hotline Fishing Hook are only available once in hardmode - just like fishing quest rewards.

If you have any problems, bugs, or suggestions contact me on my [discord](https://discord.gg/NX4DVzz2v6)!
