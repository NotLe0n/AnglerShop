[h1]Angler Shop (formally "No Fishing Quests")[/h1]
This mod adds a shop button to the Angler NPC. Now you can get your Cell Phone without needing to fish endlessly!
The Quest button is still there.

If you still like to complete quests but also want to be able to buy the items, you can toggle a setting in the mod Conig.
This will enable a custom currency that the Angler shop uses and which you can get by completing fishing quests (1-4 per quest).

The items Fin Wings and Hotline Fishing Hook are only available once in hardmode - just like fishing quest rewards.
